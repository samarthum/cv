## Relevant Experience

### Founder, CoverArtist.ai

**December 2023 – Present · Remote**

- Built and launched a production AI application that generates album artwork by chaining LLMs with diffusion models.
- Designed and implemented end-to-end system architecture, from prompt engineering to model deployment.
- Developed full-stack infrastructure using NextJS, handling user authentication and payment processing.
- Engineered robust prompt optimization and model chaining pipelines for consistent, high-quality outputs.
- Demonstrated ability to take an AI project from concept to monetized product, gaining hands-on experience with LLM development and deployment.

### Data Scientist, Bolt

**June 2022 – Present · Berlin**

- One of the earliest Data Science hires for the Micromobility vertical at a fast-growing European mobility startup.

- Scaled DS team and initiatives while serving millions of users across 100+ cities.

- **Leading the development of company-wide pricing optimization strategy** for Micromobility:

  - Architected a multi-model (including Bayesian hierarchical) forecasting system with business-knowledge-based priors and constraints to optimize pricing across pay-as-you-go rides and subscription passes, achieving a significant MAPE reduction from 14.14% to 8.7% while improving causal forecasting quality.
  - Built robust forecasting models using a Bayesian framework, handling multiple pricing scenarios across 100+ markets, guiding vertical-wide revenue decisions.&#x20;
  - Reduced average forecast MAPE by \~5% across all cities, leading to much higher-quality forecasts and downstream pricing decisions based on the model.
  - Translated an extremely ambiguous business challenge (pass vs pay-as-you-go) into a structured, data-driven solution.
  - Designed an experimental framework to measure price elasticities and cross-elasticities between different product offerings.

- **Led end-to-end development of Smart Collect**, optimizing operational efficiency:

  - Defined the north-star metric (GMV per Collection Task) through stakeholder alignment.
  - Designed rigorous A/B testing with user-centric guardrails.
  - Drove a 2.7% improvement in the primary metric while maintaining user satisfaction thresholds.
  - Orchestrated the ML-based solution to a complex operations process end-to-end.

- **Developed and scaled computer vision solutions** that impacted business growth:

  - Led ParkAssist project: defined parking quality standards, coordinated labeling efforts, and fine-tuned vision models to achieve 85%+ accuracy.
  - Processed millions of weekly parking validations across 100+ cities, improving operational efficiency and user experience.
  - Achieved best-in-class parking detection models (across all scooter competitors, from public tender evaluations)
  - Allowed us to operate in new markets, as well as helped us continue winning tenders in existing markets. Indirectly resulting in millions of new rides.

- **Developed tandem riding detection system** using a first principles approach, crucial for regulatory compliance and winning city tenders.

- **Established a data-driven product development culture**:

  - Operationalized vertical-wide standard metrics for experiments.
  - Held weekly data insights sessions with product and engineering teams to inform decision-making.

### Data Scientist, Carnot Technologies

**October 2021 – April 2022 · Remote**

- Sole Data Scientist working on agri-tech solutions for a Mahindra-backed startup.
- Wrote production-level Python code to analyze large-scale, noisy IoT data from on-board devices (OBDs) on tractors (2Hz sampling rate) to detect fuel theft.
- Performed product usage analytics for an app with over 1 million registered users.

### Data Scientist, Netcore Cloud

**March 2020 – June 2020 · Bangalore**

- Worked on customer segmentation using clustering techniques for e-commerce activity data, improving CTR of social media ads for a major Indian e-commerce website.
- Built a content recommendation system for a popular Indian (Malayalam) news outlet using pre-trained word embeddings (fastText).

### Data Science Associate, ZS

**September 2018 – February 2020 · Pune, Bangalore**

- Identified distinct treatment pathways in the US immunology market to influence the standard of care for a leading pharmaceutical company.

  - Used PySpark SQL to preprocess claims data with billions of rows.
  - Deployed an LSTM Autoencoder to generate vector embeddings of patient journeys.
  - Applied K-Means clustering on these embeddings to derive and profile distinct treatment pathways.

- Predicted progression of Kidney Cancer by building an ensemble model (XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM, and CNN) using patient-level claims data.

- Developed an interactive Jupyter Notebook pipeline for patient-level event prediction problems, reducing preliminary analysis time by 70%.

  - Wrote a Python wrapper around parametric SQL code for efficient big-data preprocessing on Redshift.
  - Created a Python library for automated hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization.

### Machine Learning Engineer – Intern, Suprath Technologies

**April 2018 – June 2018 · Bangalore**

- Built a speech emotion recognition system to determine speaker sentiment.
- Created spectrograms and used a CNN to classify them into respective classes.
- Employed novel preprocessing techniques that improved results over the state-of-the-art by 8%.
